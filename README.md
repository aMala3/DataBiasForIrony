# DataBiasForIrony
_Note: this repository is in an early stage and will be updated to include more details_

This repository contains the results for the paper "A Fine Line Between Irony and Sincerity: Identifying Bias in Transformer Models for Irony Detection" by Aaron Maladry, Els Lefever, Cynthia Van Hee and Veronique Hoste. In this repository, we present the Pearsons' Correlation between lemmatized words (or word n-grams) in our data set and the binary irony label. 
Secondly, we also investigated the average sub-token importances (generated with LRP) for our model trained for binary irony classification on the complete train set through 10-fold cross-validation.
